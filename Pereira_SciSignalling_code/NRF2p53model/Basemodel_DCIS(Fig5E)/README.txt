NRF2_p53_ODE_DCIS.m contains all differential equations and reactions for the NRF2-p53 model. The base MCF10A-5E model was adjusted to reflect (i) proportional differences in species abundance estimated from RNA-seq and (ii) an increased ROS generation rate estimated from HyPer-2 imaging. The DCIS.com model was used in Fig. 5E,F,G in PMID:Â 32291314. All steady state mat files are provided for running simulations with different genetic perturbations related to NRF2 and p53. To run shNRF2-involving perturbations without using RNAseq data to adjust initial conditions (only using Ksyn_nrf2=0.005/5 to model shNRF2 as in Fig 5G) use SS values with _noshNRF2ICs)
