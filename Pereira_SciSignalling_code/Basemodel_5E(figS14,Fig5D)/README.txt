NRF2_p53_ODE.m contains all differential equations and reactions for the NRF2-p53 model. This “base” model was calibrated to MCF10A-5E cells treated with a time course of 200 micromolar hydrogen peroxide. This model was used in Fig. 5D,F,G and fig. S14 in PMID: 32291314. All steady state mat files are provided for running simulations with different genetic perturbations related to NRF2 and p53.
